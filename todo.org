** Calculating b
*** Fredrickson, Ch 2
- For structural interfaces on order of 10 nm, any chain model should
  be fine. If < 1 nm (e.g., highly immiscible polymer blends), local
  rigidity of segment passing through interface is necessary.
  - All under the constraint that no mesoscopic model will be accurate
  
- /Kuhn segment length/: At ideal and strongly stretched state,
  R^2 = R_max
  So, 
    b = R^2_0/R_max: 
    N = R^2_0/R_max^2
      , where R^2_0 is from experiments
    and R^2 \eqdef Nb^2
    and R_max \eqdef bN
  - However, such cases are "extremeley rare"
    
- /Statistical Length/ 
  Define N (e.g., number of repeat units) 
  Fit b using either Rg^2 or R^2
