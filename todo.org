#+STARTUP: indent
#+STARTUP: overview
* DONE SEND IZZY SOP
* TODO What did I agree to prepare for Litzy?
* TODO Union spreadsheet meeting
** Talk to 1st years and others on list 
** Update lab groups? 
** 

* PROG N_Kuhn code fix (NFH & NLH)
** DONE NFH sweep : b prescribe, v options from b/d's, all chi 2.6 for now
*** DONE b10: only b101/1,2 left
*** DONE b15 looks good
*** DONE b20: only b200/1,3,4,7,10 left
** PROG Perturb (~%20) sweep
**** PROG b10 v2=0.50: 
***** v = 0.40, 0.60
***** b1v4 rerun bc stupid, b1v6 rerun 10/17--almost done
**** DONE b20 v4=1.20:
***** v = 1.00, 1.40
***** b2v0 done, b2v4 done
** PROG Initial chi sweep
**** PROG b10 vopt=2
***** chi = 2.4, 2.8, 3.0
***** b1c4 rerun 6-10, b1c8 rerun, b1c0 rerun
**** PROG b20 vopt=4
***** chi = 2.4, 2.8, 3.0
***** b2c4 rerun 6-10, b2c8 rerun, b2c0 rerun
** Best so far:
**** b=1.0; v=0.5; chi=2.6; Maxpt
**** Options: increase v a little; increase chi a little
**** Should double check if 2C exists (prob not since init = 0)
** TODO NLH 
*** TODO Need to update NFH code (from SYSG) for multichain
** DONE SEVERAL RUNS result wrong trend wrt to ionic strength; testing with homo
- NLH/b10v10H: a0.00, x1.5 -- should be no response
  - No response; good
- NLH/b10v10L: a0.20, x1.5 -- should be linear wrt debye
  
- SYSG looks correct. Dilute layers forming, 2C considered but could be effect from too small box size

- Move forward with SYSG code + changes for NF

** Calculating b
*** Fredrickson, Ch 2
- For structural interfaces on order of 10 nm, any chain model should
  be fine. If < 1 nm (e.g., highly immiscible polymer blends), local
  rigidity of segment passing through interface is necessary.
  - All under the constraint that no mesoscopic model will be accurate
  
- /Kuhn segment length/: At ideal and strongly stretched state,
  R^2 = R_max
  So, 
    b = R^2_0/R_max: 
    N = R^2_0/R_max^2
      , where R^2_0 is from experiments
    and R^2 \eqdef Nb^2
    and R_max \eqdef bN
  - However, such cases are "extremely rare"
    
- /Statistical Length/ 
  Define N (e.g., number of repeat units) 
  Fit b using either Rg^2 or R^2
