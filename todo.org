#+STARTUP: overview
* PROG N_Kuhn code fix (NFH & NLH)
** SEVERAL RUNS result wrong trend wrt to ionic strength; testing with homo
- NLH/b10v10H: a0.00, x1.5 -- should be no response
  - No response; good
- NLH/b10v10L: a0.20, x1.5 -- should be linear wrt debye
  
- SYSG looks correct. Dilute layers forming, 2C considered but could be effect from too small box size

- Move forward with SYSG code + changes for NF

** NFH sweep : b prescribe, v options from b/d's, all chi 2.6 for now
*** p_update.pptx for all options
** NLH standyby
*** Rui recommendation: different b0, v0 for each chain
* PROG Clay slides
** Calculating b
*** Fredrickson, Ch 2
- For structural interfaces on order of 10 nm, any chain model should
  be fine. If < 1 nm (e.g., highly immiscible polymer blends), local
  rigidity of segment passing through interface is necessary.
  - All under the constraint that no mesoscopic model will be accurate
  
- /Kuhn segment length/: At ideal and strongly stretched state,
  R^2 = R_max
  So, 
    b = R^2_0/R_max: 
    N = R^2_0/R_max^2
      , where R^2_0 is from experiments
    and R^2 \eqdef Nb^2
    and R_max \eqdef bN
  - However, such cases are "extremely rare"
    
- /Statistical Length/ 
  Define N (e.g., number of repeat units) 
  Fit b using either Rg^2 or R^2
