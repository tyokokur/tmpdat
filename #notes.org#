* Rui Meeting
** NFH
- p_ update slide 31
  - Forward progress in terms of getting 4 nm more drastically increased
- p_ update slide 32
  - Still not impressive when computed data shown as line only
    - Keep trying, or circles okay, or just move forward from here?
  - Density profiles show coil to coil-condensed transition
- Paper has been edited to include coil to coil-condensed, but can't
  be completed until correct height profile is made
  - Interaction between 2 brushes for addtl "characterization"
    - WIP [update if rerun]
    - Code should be done, but ran into issues when trying to run with NFH
  - Reflectivity spectra discussion still needs to be done
** NLH
- NLH slide 27
  - Fairly happy with NFL fit. Want to try mixture and see if further
    improvement necessary first
- NLH slide 29
  - Happy with NFH fit. Uses same AA chis and thresh as NFL.
- Mixture coding WIP. Have done it before, so should be straight-forward
** PE
- Kent form needed from Rui
** SYSG
- Interaction WIP (wanted to see if add to characterization section)
- Code is finished, just need to run and analyze
- Paper needs to be outlined, but

* Vol convolution notes
** Procedure
- End-point density at 50 mM (pure condensed) is base
- Multiply base by C < 1 to match max-height of desired end-point
- Shift by \Delta{}x s.t. resulting coil profile has integral of 0 until
  condensed layer ends
** Justifications
- Claim: Condensed layer is insensitive to shape of coil layer
- Shift in x reflects electrostatic repulsion of condensed layer from
  surface
- Ensuring \int_0^{coil} \phi_p = 0 keeps volume of condensed layer correct
* NFH Paper
** Introduction
- Robust coarse graining procedure
- Accurate theoretical model
- Additional insight when compared to expt
** MT
- (Figure) Schematic
- (Figure) Discretization method
- (Table)  Final charge and chi blocks
- Coarse grained model; stiffness (b^3/v) and chi_max chosen to fit
  experimental results, but fall within reasonable values
  - Rubinstein source for "stiff polymer range"
  - Source for valid chi range?
** RD
- (Figure) Height profile comparison
  - Quantitative fit reflects accuracy of SCFT and model
  - Why deviation from linear Debye length (comparison to maximum
    stretched limit)
- (Figure) Polymer density profiles
  - Height response as coil -> coil-cond. transition
  - Norm calculation as order parameter
  - Competition between \chi and \alpha
- (Figure) Block 2 density profiles
  - See if can use to surmise "role" of Block 2
- (Figure) Free Energy
  - Continuous (2nd order conformational transition)
- (Figure) Reflectivity spectra
  - Growth of peaks correspond to consistent, sharp interface of
    condensed layer
  - Transition difficult to capture from spectra (coil barely visible)
    - Calculated spectra are ideal (e.g., no roughness)
    - AFM much better to capture macroscopic details
      - Should produce sample AFM data to support this? (Fig 4b)
** Conc
- Model was successful in predicting correct response
- Conformational change 
- Reflectivity is useful in confirming predicted density profiles, but
  not for solely determining height

* NLH
** Erika narratives:
1. Role of M vs. H. Despite similarities, why both necessary in a
   neurofilament? Origin electrostatics and effect of phosphorylation
   or something else (e.g. conformational)?
2. Role of first neg. block in NFH. Makes sequence sharply
   heterogeneous.

   
** EAD0710
*** Chimax = 2.6
- Overall: 
  - Good convergence
  - H profile not bad
  - L profile wrong--Height increase at high Cs?
**** b10v14 
- H: 10, 25
**** b12v14 
- H: 25 
**** b14v14 
- H: 25
*** Chimax = 3.0
**** b14v14
- End 08/24:
  - Cs 5-100 still running
  - H still much taller than L at all Cs
    - Stiffness scales wrt b^3, but both will be affected
  - L height goes up then down: switching conformations?
  - H end block (5-7) bimodal. Ch dist. wrong?
- 08/24: Rerun L @Cs 1-3 from Cs 5 (1A-3A) and Cs 5 from Cs 3 (4A).
  - First order phase transition?
