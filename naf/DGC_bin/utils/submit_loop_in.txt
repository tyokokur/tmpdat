Comments:
* Keep "//" After first two lines for comments, as this is used as a separator in the code
* Keep "//End!//" Tells code that you are finished
* Keep //%d// format for each file. These also need to be sequential (1, 2, 3, etc.)
* Format is as follows:
Line 1: File to edit and copy to subdirectories
Line 2: Files to copy to subdirectories (e.g. *.o, *.sh, *.txt besides the edited file)
{
    Line 3: //%d// : Start of changes, integer will also be the name of the subdirectory these files will be put into
    Line 4 ~ x: Changes to edit file
        {Line number}; {What to replace that line with}
} Repeat as many times as necessary
Last line: //End!// : Used to end loop, otherwise these comments would be read as changes too.
